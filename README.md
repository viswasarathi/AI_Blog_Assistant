Configuration (Securely Storing Your Hugging Face Token)
To protect your API token, we use Streamlit's built-in secrets.

Create .streamlit/secrets.toml:

In your project root, create a folder named .streamlit.
Inside .streamlit, create a file named secrets.toml.
Add your token to secrets.toml:

Ini, TOML

# .streamlit/secrets.toml
HF_TOKEN = "hf_YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE"
Replace "hf_YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN_HERE" with your real Hugging Face token.

Update .gitignore: Ensure your .gitignore file (in the project root) includes:

.streamlit/secrets.toml
Running the Application

streamlit run app.py
